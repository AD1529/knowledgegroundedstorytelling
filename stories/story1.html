  <h1>Story 1</h1>

  <p>The chalk moves like weather when she claps—white flurries bloom, the bitter tang of magnesium sharp on her tongue. Mariia counts because numbers behave when nothing else does. Four in, four out. Board, block, lift, spot.</p>

<p>Tokyo hums around her: announcers stitching names into languages, camera shutters clicking like insects, brass notes drifting from the concourse. The American gymnast steps up—midnight-blue leotard, a star on her chest. She opens her palm to the chalk.</p>

<p>A pale seam cuts its center. A white river.</p>

<p>The lid of Mariia’s memory lifts. Coal smoke, whistles, doors banging open. Cold air biting skin. A scarfed stranger’s voice urging “Come.” Her small body lifted from a train bound for Auschwitz.</p>

<p>“Соколенко,” calls a clipped voice. Galina Zorina, Party minder, clipboard in hand, perfume neat as paper. “No wandering. No chatter with foreigners. You know the rules, Masha.”</p>

<p>Masha to the team, Mariia in records, Marie in memory. “I know,” she answers.</p>

<p>The American runs, vaults, lands solid. Applause blooms. Mariia dips her hands again, eyes pulled back to the scar. Her heartbeat pounds iron on track.</p>

<p>Coach Irina Belova leans close, smelling of liniment. “Look at me. Ballet arms. Shoulders down. Breathe. You can carry only what fits on the runway.”</p>

<p>Mariia runs, hits, flies, sticks. But relief doesn’t come. That space is filled by a child’s hand and a scar.</p>

<p>Back in line, the American is too near. Chalk haze softens borders. “You did well,” Mariia blurts in halting English.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” The girl’s eyes search her face.</p>

<p>Mariia gestures. “Your hand.”</p>

<p>The American opens it. The scar glows.</p>

<p>“Youra,” Mariia whispers—their rescuer’s name.</p>

<p>The American breathes: “Georges.”</p>

<p>Galina steps in. “Time. We don’t keep judges waiting.”</p>

<p>After, the schedule tightens like wire. Keys vanish, minders linger. A form appears on Mariia’s table: Medical Rest, waiting for her signature.</p>

<p>Irina intercepts. “She needs ballet,” she tells Galina blandly. Later, in the mirrored studio under the stands, she slips a folded note into Mariia’s palm.</p>

<p>Interpreter Kenji Sato appears with a clipboard. “Equipment check,” he says, leading them through a corridor that smells of rubber and steam.</p>

<p>Anne waits by a vending machine, face lit in blue. For a moment, they are children again under a swaying lamp.</p>

<p>“I think—” Mariia begins.</p>

<p>“I know,” Anne says. “I’m Anne
